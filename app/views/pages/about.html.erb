<h1>About</h1>

<div id="aboutPitch">
	<p>
		Protovore Partners exists at the intersection of the 'hacker' and startup communities.  We live to build, but also build to live.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each of us is working in our own ways and according to our own agendas to materially improve society. This can be a daunting task and a winding road, but to the true-believer, a required undertaking.
	</p>
	<p>	
	Protovore Partners is our way of taking advantage of our collective capacities to provide a healthy lifestyle for ourselves as we pursue our individually-held causes or search for an appropriate cause or company to truly devote ourselves to. We are practical fanatics.
	</p>
	<p>
	If you take a moment to think about this, you'll realize this makes us very good partners to have on your project.
