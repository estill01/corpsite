<h1>About</h1>

<div id="aboutPitch">
	<p>
		Protovore Partners exists at the intersection of the 'hacker' and startup communities.  We live to build, but also build to live.
	</p>
	<p>
		We solve technology, product, and business challenges - from building prototypes to scaling systems - because that's what we love to do.

	<h2>Pragmatic Fanatics</h2>	
	<p>
	The most important thing to keep in mind when considering working with us - be it as a partner or a client - is that we are hyper competitive, dedicated to innovation, and expect you to share these characteristics.
	</p>
	<p>
	We are not your typical 'dev shop'. We will not simply churn out a moving version of your spec sheet.</p>

	<p>
	We will build with you to help you solve your technology, product, and business challenges in all their dimensions. 
	
	And when we are done, you will have a more robust product, but most importantly, you will be a better company.
	
	</p>
	<p>
	If you hold yourself to these same standards and seek to become a truly competitive technology-driven enterprise, we look forward to working with you.	
	</p>
